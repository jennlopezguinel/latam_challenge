# Model Development Summary

## 1. Objectives
- Convert `exploration.ipynb` content into `model.py`.
- Ensure best practices for Python-based Machine Learning development.
- Evaluate model performance using AUC and accuracy metrics.

## 2. Steps Taken
### Data Exploration
- Added a function `exploratory_analysis` to visualize:
  - Flights by airline, day, and month.

### Data Preprocessing
- Converted date columns (`Fecha-I`, `Fecha-O`) to datetime format.
- Handled null values by dropping rows where dates were missing.
- Created new features:
  - `period_day`: Categorizes flights into morning, afternoon, or night.
  - `high_season`: Indicates if the flight occurred during a high-demand season.
  - `min_diff`: Difference in minutes between scheduled and actual times.
  - `delay`: Binary label based on a 15-minute threshold for delays.

### Model Development
- Used `LogisticRegression` for binary classification.
- Split data into training and testing sets (67% train, 33% test).
- Trained the model with `max_iter=1000` to ensure convergence.

## 3. Results
- **AUC**: 0.517
- **Accuracy**: 81.45%

## 4. Observations
- The high accuracy reflects an imbalance in delay distribution (likely dominated by non-delayed flights).
- AUC indicates poor distinction between delayed and non-delayed flights.

## 5. Recommendations
- Perform feature engineering to enhance discriminative power (e.g., interaction terms, external data sources).
- Address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weights in the logistic regression model.
- Experiment with other algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for potentially better performance.

## 6. Next Steps
- Improve feature selection and engineering.
- Evaluate additional metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) to capture model effectiveness.
- Refine hyperparameters or explore other classification methods.
